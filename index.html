				<h3>Anabela Goncalves</h3>
				<h4>s3861641</h4>
				<p>I was born in Sydney, Australia to Portuguese parents and as such I grew it was important for my parents for me to learn to speak Portuguese, therefore I am fully bilingual in both languages, although reading and writing of Portuguese takes a lot more effort to comprehend.
				Through my European heritage I have come to appreciate architecture that depicts a time, originality, uses elements of nature, and can identify a country or even city / region of origin. I cannot say I appreciate modern architecture. It makes me feel personally like we lack originality. E.g. I admire how artwork on ceilings in Europe, how they have stood the test of time, and I am amazed at how the artist could do such work without having constant pain in the neck!</p>

				<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
				<article>
					<p>
						Machine learning, at its core, is essentially the concept of implementing computer systems with the ability to automatically learn and improve, from prior experience, without having necessarily been programmed or coded to do so. Machine Learning (ML) is both a subfield and explicit component of Artificial intelligence. ML, along with natural language processing (NLP), robotics, speech and vision learning are core components of what makes up today's AI technology.
					</p><p>	
						ML’s initial learning process consists of observation of data in the form of examples, direct experience and instruction to better develop decision making as well as to analyse patterns in the data. This is all done without explicit instructions to enable the program to find relationships in the data. Put simply, ML software works by linking an input with an output, in most cases the input are data sets provided in the algorithms and the output is the desired action of the ML. Modern algorithms that teach ML systems incorporate an approach based on semantic analysis, which mimics the human ability to understand the meaning of text​.
						There are two main categories that exist when it comes to ML algorithms; Supervised and Unsupervised learning.
						Supervised learning is when the system is fed validation data to test accuracy and the “learning” takes place during this stage. Within supervised learning, one of the main methods used is classification.
						Classification is when the system is given a set of data and is provided with “categories”, the machine then groups the data into the given categories.
						Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning provides no training data or an output requirement, the purpose is to allow the system to discover naturally occurring patterns in the data.
						One of the main methods of unsupervised learning is anomaly detection where outlier information is detected and interpreted. This is most commonly used in fraud prevention to track suspicious behaviour or financial patterns.
					</p><p>
						We may not realise it but Machine learning is already deeply integrated into some of the products and services we heavily rely on and use daily. Some major examples of machine learning are:
					</p><p>
						<ul>
							<li>Google uses machine learning to create personalized advertising options.</li>
							<li>Spotify uses machine learning for playlist recommendations.</li>
							<li>Uber and Lyft use machine learning for travel time estimations.</li>
							<li>Amazon uses machine learning to predict and analyze the purchasing behavior of its
							customers.</li>
							<li>Text analysis for mapping out content and finding trending topics.</li>
							<li>Analytics for finding and investing in quality real estate.</li>
							<li>Call verification in the fraud recovery process.</li>
							<li>Price tracking for air travel to find the best deals</li>


						</ul>
						<p>(​https://learn.g2.com/machine-learning​)</p> 
						
 				</p><p> 
  					Machine learning has had a major impact on the digital landscape, and will continue to do so in the coming future. With technology progressing at such a rapid rate, it's important to be aware of how this advanced form of data analysis aids us each and every day. Along with the list of common uses of ML listed above, here are some more implementations in a little more detail:
 				</p><p> 
 					<h4>Email Spam Detection</h4>
					 ​It wouldn't be wrong to assume​ ​most of all use email services daily, and most of us are used to receiving spam and advertising material consistently. Services such as Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo have different algorithms for filtering out this material and separating it from the more important information we want to stay on top of. This is done through machine learning. The algorithm sees patterns in the kind of content we regularly get and can make predictions and decisions when things like spam are sent to us, and differentiate it from our regular inbox.
				</p><p>
					<h4>Face recognition​</h4>
					Facial recognition has seen a massive spike in popularity on some of the technology we rely on daily. Services such as Facebook can make suggestions to you, asking whether you would like to tag a friend in your new profile picture just based on the facial scanning of the other person in the photo. Similarly Facebook can alert you if you are in someone else's photo and can suggest to them to tag you. Another huge use of this is iPhones face unlock, when you set up your new iPhone, the first thing people do is train the device to recognise their face for security reasons.
				</p><p>
					<h4>Speech recognition​</h4>
					Just like facial recognition, speech recognition is just as popular nowadays on most of our smart devices. Products like Google assistant, Amazon echo and Apples Siri are all forms of machine learning speech recognition. It is trained to recognise patterns in your voice and interpret what you are asking it to do, and perform accordingly.
				</p><p>
					Whilst machine learning is quite powerful on its own, it's important to understand advancements in the technology and how a more powerful and complex iteration of ML is used today and this is where deep learning comes in. Deep learning is somewhat of an extension of machine learning, It operates in a similar fashion in that it acquires data and trains itself with no assistance. With deep learning, however, the way it processes this data is through the use of artificial neural networks and this is what separates it from machine learning. The goal of deep learning is to artificially mimic the way a human brain’s neural network stores and recalls information. It makes use of many layers of nodes (neurons) and is capable of learning on its own and making adjustments to itself and its algorithms. Unlike machine learning, deep learning requires much more data in order to learn.
    				​This could be in the form of millions of images and
 					lines of text or thousands of hours of video footage. In some cases, like for driverless cars, it’s a culmination of many types of data.
 				</p><p>
 
					Some of the major companies that are prominently leading the way in deep learning and AI are DeepMind and OpenAI (co-founded by Elon Musk). These companies are on the cutting edge of what deep learning and AI is capable of and have conquered some impressive milestones along the way. In 2016, DeepMinds AlphaGo program beat world champion Go player Lee Sedol and this really started to indicate what machine learning was capable of. Another one of Elon musk's founded companies, Neuralink, is dedicated to developing and producing chips that are implanted in the skull of those suffering from motor neuron problems, stroke victims, quadriplegics and paraplegics. The chip is then used to reconnect the damaged neural links in the brain, and restore limb and nerve function. This may sound like something out of a sci-fi movie, but deep learning and artificial neural networking lie at the heart of the experimental research.
				</p><p>
					I personally am very excited to see what the future holds and I totally embrace the new age of machine learning that we will no doubt enter very soon. Services such as self driving vehicles will immensely help the transportation industry, as well as providing those who may not be able to drive themselves with the freedom to travel on their own. Technology such as eldercare and enhanced health care will take some of the strain of our already endlessly working health workers. Home security will become smarter and safer, allowing those adopting the technology a greater sense of peace knowing their family and valuables are safe due to AI like systems protecting their property. I believe all of these areas and much more will allow us to advance as a society and achieve greater and better things. These advancements are the stepping stones that humanity needs to take to enable us to progress in ways thought impossible 50 years ago.

				<h3>CyberSecurity</h3>
				<article>
					<p>
						Most people not involved in the Information Technology Sector who hear the word Cybersecurity think of anti-virus programs for their personal computer. Truth be told Cybersecurity encompasses so much more. Digital Guardian (2020) describes Cyber security as;
					</p><p>	
						The body of technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect networks, devices, programs, and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. Cyber security may also be referred to as information technology security.
					</p><p>	
						To put it simply Cybersecurity protects infrastructure and information in a world where Cyber Attacks are more and more common. The scale of Cyber Attacks is staggering with 7.9 billion records having been exposed by data breaches in the first nine months of 2019. (Risk Based Security 2019)
					</p><p>	
						Like physical security on a house or business such as a lock or security screen, Cybersecurity protects your personal data and digital devices. Importantly Cybersecurity isn’t simply powerful anti-virus programs, but also training and risk management with an emphasis on evolving with the technology as it becomes more sophisticated and advanced. 
					</p><p>	
						Cybersecurity can be broken down into numerous equally important fields which include but are not limited to;
						<ul>
							<li>Network security</li>
							<li>Applications security</li>
							<li>Information security</li>
							<li>Operational security</li>
							<li>Data Security</li>
							<li>Identity management</li>
							<li>Database and Infrastructure security</li>
							<li>Disaster recovery & business continuity</li>
							<li>End-user education</li>
						</ul>	
					</p><p>
						The primary reasons to have adequate Cybersecurity are Cyber Crime and Cyber Terrorism.
					</p><p>	
						Cyber Crime includes everything from identify theft; the use of fake emails to get personal information (Phishing), shutting down or misusing websites, distribution of child pornography. Medical devices have also been targets such as cardiac implants.
					</p><p>	
						Cyber Terrorism includes a cyber-attack on critical infrastructure including dams and power stations. 
					</p><p>	
						As hackers become more sophisticated, so too will Cybersecurity technology as continued improvement and innovation race to keep our data secure. Currently only government institutions in Australia and some larger businesses employ Cybersecurity experts to monitor their systems complete upgrades and actively monitor and defend their networks. You might ask as a smaller business, who can’t afford to employ a Cybersecurity team, “what can be done now to protect against these threats?” The answer is simple, better education, up to date anti-virus software and the use of a Web Application Firewalls. These simple steps will help you be more secure in modern times while new technology is still being developed. 
						There are several areas in which Cybersecurity is being developed and improved that are classed as state of the art technology that will be very important in the future:
					</p><p>	
						<h4>Big Data</h4>
						
						Big Data is an upcoming technology which some say will have a big impact on the Cybersecurity Space. Big Data will allow analysts to examine large and diversified amounts of system data instantly and in real time. This means that irregularities such as cyber criminals intruding into a system can be detected and stopped quickly, to prevent the theft of data or damage being done to critical systems. Although Big Data is still in its early stages, the results of its use so far in the Cybersecurity Sphere appear to be extremely promising. As the technology continues to be refined some are calling Big Data the new Guardian Angel of Cybersecurity.
					</p><p>	
						<h4>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h4>

						Another area progressing quickly in the Cybersecurity space is Artificial Intelligence coupled with Machine learning. This new upcoming technology will greatly improve security against cyber threats by being smarter and faster than humans. Examples of current technology utilising Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity are Biometric logins for computers, company systems and smart devices such as phones and tablets. Perhaps the biggest benefit of AI and Machine Learning is that hackers and some organisations sponsored by foreign governments are themselves using AI to infiltrate, corrupt and steal data more frequently. By continuing our own improvements of AI and Machine Learning we can fight AI with AI. Balbix.com says that AI will be able to instantly spot any malware on a network, guide incident response and detect intrusions before they start”. 
					</p><p>	
						These state-of-the-art processes are made possible with advancement in hardware, software and the big leaps forward experienced by the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence sectors. 
					</p><p>	
						<h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>

						As technology in Cybersecurity continues to improve to fight cyber crime and terrorism, the development will drive the percentage of cyber crime attacks down. People most affected by the future development of Cybersecurity Systems will be criminals and foreign governments who currently engage in wide spread cyber terrorism such as China. China currently utilises cyber-attacks to steal technological secrets. The impact can be seen clearly with a recent attack on Australian organisations across a range of sectors such as government, industry, education and health in 2020. The positive side of development and new future technologies in Cybersecurity will be the company data, technological secrets, health and financial data will be safe from theft. This will especially benefit the elderly in our communities who most unfortunately are not very tech savvy and are regularly the victims of cyber-crime.
					</p><p>
						The progressions of technology in the Cyber Security’s space will continue to make jobs. As smaller businesses become more aware of the threats of Cybercrime, upgrades to security systems will increase creating jobs. Jobs will also increase in the education section of Cybersecurity as more companies realise that they need to educate employees of the dangers to make the work environment a safe place. 
						Not only is the demand for Cybersecurity professionals high in Australia, but it is high across the world. Michael Brown CEO of Symantec (2016) said “There are currently one million cyber security jobs globally. This demand is projected to increase to 6 million by 2019, with an expected short fall of 1.5 million”.

					</p><p>
						<h4>How will this affect you?</h4>

						In my opinion cyber security will have a big impact on my life going into the future. As Cybersecurity capabilities grow, so will the abilities of people who wish to steal data and attack infrastructure across the world. I believe it is only a matter of time before a large-scale attack directly affects me, be it though my credit card data being stolen or something more serious, such as the power to my house or business being affected by an attack on the nation’s power grid. What will be different for me in the future is I will now work harder to be better prepared and aware of Cybersecurity. 
					</p><p>
						I will ensure my family and friends know about the need for Cybersecurity to protect themselves. I will help them understand the need for regular software updates on their personal devices to help keep them safe. I will help educate family members about the seriousness of Cybercrime and need for Cybersecurity. In particular I will ensure family and friends know to keep an eye out for the following threats;
					</p><p>
						<ul>
							<li>Suspicious Links</li>
							<li>Password promiscuity</li>
							<li>Mal Ware</li>
							<li>Phishing emails</li>
						</ul>	
					</p><p>
						I hope by educating myself and my family and friends we can all understand how to protect ourselves adequately utilising Cybersecurity.
					</p><p>
						I am interested to see in the future how technology will grow and and change for the better to provide better protection for my personal details and data.

				<h3>Blockchain</h3>
				<article>
					<p>
						Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies
						A blockchain is a secure technology that records data, mostly transactions on a peer-2-peer network, also described as a digital ledger. Broken down, a blockchain is a decentralized time- stamped series of unmodifiable records of data. Picture a chain of blocks, the blocks represent data, which are held together in a distinct order, which is the chain of blocks. Data that is stored on the blocks contain information about the transaction (date, time, amount), what parties are involved in the transaction (via a “digital signature”), and details that differentiate a single block from another block in the chain. The information is manifested into a particular code called a “hash”. A hash is a very unique code, like a fingerprint.
						What makes this technology so secure is that each new block that is added to the chain is stored linearly and chronologically, so it will always be added to the end of the chain and will not only contain its own hash but also contain the hash of the previous block. Which visually forms the chain and makes sure that the information in the block can not be tampered with because if you change one block then you would have to go through every other block after it in the chain, and change all of the hashes they contain as well. Which would take a lot of time, effort and computer power. So once a block is added to the chain it becomes very difficult to change and impossible to delete. Another factor that keeps the technology so secure is because it also implements tests for computers that want to join and add blocks to the chain. The tests require the users to “prove” themselves before they can participate in a blockchain network. The technology was first created back in 1991 by two researchers by the names of Stuart Haber and Scott Stornetta, to carry out a system where document timestamps could not be altered. It wasn’t used much until nearly 20 years later in 2009 when it was adapted by an unknown person or group known by the alias of “Satoshi Nakomoto” to create a crypto currency called Bitcoin. Blockchains serve as a distributed ledger and act as a financial transaction database for many Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
						A Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it virtually impossible to counterfeit or double spend. Most cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks that use the blockchain technology and are generally not issued by any central authority, making them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation. There are more than over 2,000 different types of digital cryptocurrencies available at the moment like Litecoin, Peercoin, Namecoin, Ethereum and notably the most well known being Bitcoin. As of November 2019, there are an estimated 18 million Bitcoins in circulation with a total market value of AU $209 billion dollars. In most cases new coins are are created when transactions are confirmed by a process known as mining. Bitcoin miners clump transactions together in blocks and add them to a public record which is better knows as the “blockchain.” Nodes then maintain records of the blocks so they can be verified in the future. The incentive for miners is they get rewarded. Bitcoin miners are compensated for their efforts by receiving bitcoin whenever they have attributed to adding a new block of transactions to the blockchain. The amount released is called a “block reward”. The reward is halved every 4 years or every 210,000 blocks and at the moment it is at 6.25. So for every blocked mined until 2024 the miners will receive 6.25 bitcoin and in 2024 it will go down to 3.125 bitcoin per block.
					</p><p>	
						This technology has the potential to impact many sectors and industries. By creating a decentralized data base which is free for public viewing it has the potential to really disrupt the
						financial sector. Many banks and financial service providers are analysing and researching with blockchain for the utilization of money transfers and record keeping, among other back-end functions. Blockchain applications change the old style of paper-intensive international trading processes into a decentralized ledger that provides everyone the ability to securely access the information from a single source. Blockchain also combats fraud. Financial institutions all over the world are discovering a rising number of total scams. Fraudsters are manipulating people to pay money to them. Blockchain combats this by facilitating the use of smart contracts to support storage of any type of digital information. Cryptocurrency also change the way people conduct financial transactions. Crypto banking will integrate itself into the financial industry due to its impressive uptake. It’s a huge improvement to the traditional systems that have a centralized system where one entity facilitates and controls your money. Because cryptocurrencies are decentralized they offer services that will never be available in conventional banks and also guarantee more efficiency, transparency and security. By eliminating the middle man, cryptocurrencies cut out the need of having to deal with one organization that holds your money. Instead your money is held on the cloud with the blockchain technology. Cryptocurrency transactions are generally cheaper than the way we traditionally make a money transfer as well. Usually when you pay a vendor with our credit card we are hit with a processing fee of a couple percent, this is mostly because we are paying fees to more than one organization that deals with processing the transaction. Many businesses are across different industries are also decentralizing their processes with the bitcoin technology to save money on costs and acquire more profit.

						The Blockchain and Cryptocurrency technologies together are a way to revolutionize the future of banking. If digital cryptocurrency ends up taking over the whole traditional centralized banking systems as we now know it, it will become normal for everyone on the planet to use in their daily life. No more will I be able to carry physical cash around and pay for items. Instead of having a wallet in my back pocket, I will have all my money stored on an e-wallet to pay for items. Cryptocurrency could become the standard currency for all around the world, abolishing exchange rate fees and other costs that come with changing up money as well. If we move to a cashless society I think it could become a scary thing, it takes away the process of buying something anonymously, everyone will be able to see how and where I spend my cash. No more will I be able to put money away in my wardrobe or under my bed to save up for a holiday, or even jump on gumtree and buy something second hand with cash. It will all be recorded. I think some people will tend to overspend as well, when I buy something using cash, I recognise the financial effect by physically taking the cash out of my wallet and giving it to someone. With electronic payments its easy to just click pay and not realise how much money I am actually spending. If the financial future of banking becomes cashless and ends up being one that relies on the blockchain and crytocurrency, I will embrace it but I find it hard to imagine a time when you wont be able to slip some cash into a family members birthday card, or little kids not receiving money from the tooth fairy when losing a tooth.

				<h3>Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
				<article>
					<p>
						An autonomous vehicle is a driverless car that has the ability to operate itself without any human intervention and performs the necessary functions through sensing its surroundings and using it as a reference to calculate its movements since it is equipped with a fully automated driving system that allows the vehicle to respond to outer conditions that human drivers would have managed. Sensors and software are combined so that it is able to navigate through different areas, there are six levels of autonomous driving, no human intervention, cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping, mostly automatic, and fully automatic. The current state that autonomous vehicles have achieved and which are available to the public is at level three, lane-keeping, and it is considered partially autonomous because whilst it can perform all parts of driving in specific conditions, the human driver is needed to regain control once the driving system has notified to do so. While level four has been achieved, it is in a very limited sense because it requires all driving tasks to be performed independently in certain conditions with no human attention, and is currently being tested and only used by shuttles and employee busses, but even with level four having strict pre-sets there is a strong possibility that it can be implemented into general driving in the future, this will prove to be a difficult task since the driver is supposed to be ready for when the alert to return to the wheel is set off (usually after a long period of time) which can be a challenge because the human driver may be unable to take over or is distracted which could result to putting the driver themself and others at risk. "Thus, to avoid the difficulty of relying on user vigilance, this camp suggests that ADS (Automated Driving System) must leap straight to full automation and remove the control away from the drivers completely" (C. Chan 2017). In the meantime there are developments that have assistive or fully automated parking systems that are available to the public, these developments will further allow autonomous vehicles to be used every day. In particular, systems such as connected vehicle technology that provides "Real-time data and information about the surrounding traffic conditions and is expected to improve the efficiency, response, and comfort while enhancing safety and mobility" (Elsevier 2016 p.g 143-163), which provides benefits to society such as personal mobility and automation for elderly users as well as real-time navigation and improved traffic management flows and safe, reliable, and productive services for transportation as a whole. In the world of machine learning, lidar uses a laser with radars and ultrasonic sensors that work together. As well as 5G technology which will greatly increase the reliability of autonomous vehicles since it will be able to communicate through other vehicles, signage, traffic lights, and roads. Therefore, increasing safety for the general public since automated driving will result in changes in infrastructure, it has been predicted that "Self-driving cars could reduce traffic fatalities by more than 90%" (C. Chan 2017).
					</p>
					<p>
						The developments of autonomous systems are likely to impact people in various ways, such as reducing casualties from road accidents which will improve safety. Self-driving technology would be able to provide advantages such as reducing traffic congestion by keeping a buffer between the cars in front of them and themselves, which will allow vehicles to brake less often. as well as eliminating driving fatigue and being able to sleep through journeys with autonomous vehicles; stress-free parking will also happen because it has the ability to detect vacant parking spots which reduces the waste of fuel and time. Implementing self-driving cars will also change the infrastructure dramatically since vehicles will have increased accuracy and precision which allows roads to be narrower and expand pedestrian spaces, and it will also allow those unable to use transportation due to factors such as age and disabilities to become more independent, since they will have the ability to use automated vehicles as accessible transportation. However, the advance on autonomous technology will cause unemployment to many jobs revolving around the transportation field which could ultimately proceed to make the public transport funding to become redundant and greatly reduce job opportunities for others as the artificial intelligence proceeds to overthrow the roles of a human. Autonomous vehicles are prone to hacking and could then become a major target for hackers and "May lead to the possible collection of personal data" (HalfFastChicago 2018). As well as the number of donor organs will drop by 13% since it is acquired from car crash victims. While the high-technology vehicles are useful and revolutionary, they are also extremely expensive since functional materials and equipment are needed such as sensors, system software, and vehicle parts. It is possible that unpredicted system faults may happen and therefore raising safety and security concerns with the public.

			<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
			<h3>SIFT</h3>
			<p>SIFT is a platform which allows users to consolidate their Facebook, Twitter and Instagram timeline into one customisable experience, where pages and friends are able to be grouped into various “Feeds”. SIFT stands for ​S​croll through ​I​nstagram,​ F​acebook and ​T​witter as well as playing on the concept of “sifting” through timelines. This app provides a one stop shop for your social media needs. 80% of the content isn’t always what the user is interested in seeing, so SIFT allows you to customise what is on feeds and gives control over the updates from friends, family or news sources etc.</p>
			<p>The first implementation of SIFT will look very different to how the later stage concepts have been envisioned. SIFT will initially be designed as a desktop site that embeds a single Twitter feed, as it is the simplest of the three platforms to integrate. The minimum viable product will consist of a simple interface that allows basic interaction with a Twitter timeline, posting and replying from within SIFT will hopefully be configured as well.
			To import a single Twitter feed we will need to acquire the customised code for HTML from Twitter Publish​. Once on the Twitter publish home page we can enter the Twitter URL we wish to embed and are prompted to choose between “embedded timeline” or “Twitter buttons”. After making a decision the code needs to be copied into the HTML of the SIFT website.
			The use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript will be the heart of the web pages design and layout. Java may also play a crucial role later on in the build process, especially if SIFT moves from a website to a mobile application.
			Access and privacy will be another area of great importance, so to combat this, the desktop site will make use of oAuth. The users online safety is paramount so keeping their login details secure and preventing unwanted access by other apps is key to gaining the users trust. oAuth will act as a delegate, requesting and receiving tokens to allow the 3rd party site to access Twitter securely and without disclosing the users login details.</p>
			<p>
			In much later iterations, creating SIFT will no doubt involve a lot of problem solving and fine tuning as it will essentially compile information from 3 major social media infrastructures. Users will log in to each of their respective accounts, using an oAuth framework, and will then select which friends, accounts and pages they want to bring over to be viewed inside SIFT, having the choice of which content is displayed on the Feed will be another major draw of the platform.
			Comparisons with platforms such as Hootsuite can be made to SIFT as they both tackle the concept of compiling and integrating all your social media into one place. Hootsuite’s approach to this is very different to SIFTs as it forces the user to create different tabs and blocks of</p>
 			<p>
			information for each social media platform, SIFT, however, will aim to create a simpler and user friendly interface that houses all of the selected content in ​one ​feed.
			Feeds are custom lists of updates and statuses that have been brought in from their respective platforms. By default the “main” Feed will be created and selectable from a tab in the UI, this Feed will contain all the accounts and pages brought over.
			From the Feeds screen, custom feeds can be created, named and content can be assigned (for eg. a Feed called “family” contains the Facebook, Twitter and Instagram of close relatives. Or another Feed named “Cats and News” contains cat pages from instagram and news sources from Twitter). The possibilities are endless and it gives the user full control over the type of content they want to see.</p>
			<p>If later versions of the platform come to fruition and the vision for SIFT is fully realised, then hopefully it will remove the overwhelming urge to be up to date on all social media platforms and have helped alleviate the frustration of having to toggle between 3 or even 4 different apps to get an understanding of what your friends and family are up to. SIFT will have an impact on the users productivity and mental state by being able to open up only one application and be satisfied with all the available content.</p>

			<h2>Group Reflection</h2>
			<h4>Kristopher-Lee Hand</h4>
			<p>Working as a group is something that I am new to, as I haven’t really had to before. Early on we decided as a group to use Discord as the platform to communicate to one and another with. We had our weekly meetings every Saturday morning at 11:30am that would usually go for an hour and we all generally made it to the meetings, unless something important came up. During our chats we would talk with each other about what needs to be done and then as a group we would decide who would do what task towards the assignment. One speed hump we did encounter in week 7, which was one week before the Assignment 2 is due, one of our team members Tessa ended up having to drop out of the course due for personal reasons. Her task towards Assignment 2 was the IT Technologies part. As a group we needed to get that done before the dead line so we divided it into 4 sections and everyone chipped in and did their part to get it done. I think we handled that situation quite well and I enjoyed working in a group more than what I was expecting. </p>
