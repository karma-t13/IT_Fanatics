				<h3>Anabela Goncalves</h3>
				<h4>s3861641</h4>
				<p>I was born in Sydney, Australia to Portuguese parents and as such I grew it was important for my parents for me to learn to speak Portuguese, therefore I am fully bilingual in both languages, although reading and writing of Portuguese takes a lot more effort to comprehend.
				Through my European heritage I have come to appreciate architecture that depicts a time, originality, uses elements of nature, and can identify a country or even city / region of origin. I cannot say I appreciate modern architecture. It makes me feel personally like we lack originality. E.g. I admire how artwork on ceilings in Europe, how they have stood the test of time, and I am amazed at how the artist could do such work without having constant pain in the neck!</p>

			<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
			<p>SIFT is a platform which allows users to consolidate their Facebook, Twitter and Instagram timeline into one customisable experience, where pages and friends are able to be grouped into various “Feeds”. SIFT stands for ​S​croll through ​I​nstagram,​ F​acebook and ​T​witter as well as playing on the concept of “sifting” through timelines. This app provides a one stop shop for your social media needs. 80% of the content isn’t always what the user is interested in seeing, so SIFT allows you to customise what is on feeds and gives control over the updates from friends, family or news sources etc.</p>
			<p>The first implementation of SIFT will look very different to how the later stage concepts have been envisioned. SIFT will initially be designed as a desktop site that embeds a single Twitter feed, as it is the simplest of the three platforms to integrate. The minimum viable product will consist of a simple interface that allows basic interaction with a Twitter timeline, posting and replying from within SIFT will hopefully be configured as well.
			To import a single Twitter feed we will need to acquire the customised code for HTML from Twitter Publish​. Once on the Twitter publish home page we can enter the Twitter URL we wish to embed and are prompted to choose between “embedded timeline” or “Twitter buttons”. After making a decision the code needs to be copied into the HTML of the SIFT website.
			The use of HTML and CSS will be the heart of the web pages design and layout. Java may also play a crucial role later on in the build process, especially if SIFT moves from a website to a mobile application.
			Access and privacy will be another area of great importance, so to combat this, the desktop site will make use of oAuth. The users online safety is paramount so keeping their login details secure and preventing unwanted access by other apps is key to gaining the users trust. oAuth will act as a delegate, requesting and receiving tokens to allow the 3rd party site to access Twitter securely and without disclosing the users login details.</p>
			<p>
			In much later iterations, creating SIFT will no doubt involve a lot of problem solving and fine tuning as it will essentially compile information from 3 major social media infrastructures. Users will log in to each of their respective accounts, using an oAuth framework, and will then select which friends, accounts and pages they want to bring over to be viewed inside SIFT, having the choice of which content is displayed on the Feed will be another major draw of the platform.
			Comparisons with platforms such as Hootsuite can be made to SIFT as they both tackle the concept of compiling and integrating all your social media into one place. Hootsuite’s approach to this is very different to SIFTs as it forces the user to create different tabs and blocks of</p>
 			<p>
			information for each social media platform, SIFT, however, will aim to create a simpler and user friendly interface that houses all of the selected content in ​one ​feed.
			Feeds are custom lists of updates and statuses that have been brought in from their respective platforms. By default the “main” Feed will be created and selectable from a tab in the UI, this Feed will contain all the accounts and pages brought over.
			From the Feeds screen, custom feeds can be created, named and content can be assigned (for eg. a Feed called “family” contains the Facebook, Twitter and Instagram of close relatives. Or another Feed named “Cats and News” contains cat pages from instagram and news sources from Twitter). The possibilities are endless and it gives the user full control over the type of content they want to see.</p>
			<p>If later versions of the platform come to fruition and the vision for SIFT is fully realised, then hopefully it will remove the overwhelming urge to be up to date on all social media platforms and have helped alleviate the frustration of having to toggle between 3 or even 4 different apps to get an understanding of what your friends and family are up to. SIFT will have an impact on the users productivity and mental state by being able to open up only one application and be satisfied with all the available content.</p>
