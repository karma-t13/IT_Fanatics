				<h3>Anabela Rodrigues</h3>
				<h4>s3861641</h4>
				<p>I was born in Sydney, Australia to Portuguese parents and as such I grew it was important for my parents for me to learn to speak Portuguese, therefore I am fully bilingual in both languages, although reading and writing of Portuguese takes a lot more effort to comprehend.
				Through my European heritage I have come to appreciate architecture that depicts a time, originality, uses elements of nature, and can identify a country or even city / region of origin. I cannot say I appreciate modern architecture. It makes me feel personally like we lack originality. E.g. I admire how artwork on ceilings in Europe, how they have stood the test of time, and I am amazed at how the artist could do such work without having constant pain in the neck!</p>

				<p>I was born and raised in Melbourne but I have both Dutch and Scotish heritage, although only english is spoken at home - I did learn some Indonesian in primary school. I completed my VCE year 12 in 2014 and then went on to complete a Bachelor in Sound Production in 2017. I found a love for Audio and AV whilst in my final years of highschool and decided to pursue it further. I have had the opportunity to tour the country through my work and have met some amazing artists such as John Farnham, Jimmy Barnes and Joan Jett to name a few. Some hobbies of mine include playing video games, creating music, listening to vinyls and binging movie series with my partner. I currently have 2 family dogs, Zera and Archie. One is a massive Kelpie cross and the other is a tiny tibetan spaniel but wouldn't know it. In terms of sports or pastimes I occasionally play golf with my dad now and then as well as support Hawthorn in the AFL.</p>
